### Backgrounds: 
I have this problems for months that everytime I open a project in Idea, the project keep reloading from minutes to seconds. I had tried cleaning cache, deleting `.idea` folder and reinstalling Idea, but nothing works. IDEA's version is 2024.2.4. My device is Macbook M1 Pro with macOS Sonoma v14.0.

### Solution:
I found this website and it turns out the problem is related to the privacy constraints that mac has.
